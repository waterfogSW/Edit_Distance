## Edit Distance

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character : cost = 1
- Delete a character : cost = 1
- Replace a character
  - if replacing character is **same** : cost = 0
  - else : cost = 2

## Usage

- Input 2 word to get cost of edit
- Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘**String 1**’ into ‘**String 2**’.
